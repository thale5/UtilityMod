# UtilityMod
Cities Skylines UtilityMod for my personal use. All credit for the original mods goes to their authors.

Currently contains the following:

Anarchy (LeftAlt-L) : Based on (Advanced) Road Anarchy by emf and northfacts.
I have fixed the issue where road segments clamp to the ground. As a side effect extremely steep slopes
are no longer possible but those look unrealistic anyway.

Angles (LeftAlt-K) : Based on Sharp Junction Angles by Thaok.
I have disabled snapping to roads and tracks.

Water (LeftAlt-W) : Based on No Water Check by boformer.
